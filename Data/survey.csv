",Neither agree nor disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,"I think this is a fairly difficult couple of questions to answer for a few reasons. Firstly, there are absolutely studies, which then form evidence based practice in sport and other fields (i.e. medicine), where their failure to replicate, and their foundations being built off false positives would be very alarming and I think establishing what these areas are is important. But secondly, we are moving into a space of individualised interventions both within sport and other subfields. It would be expected in these studies that demonstrate how this can be achieved that things won't replicate, and it is likely that things will vary from individual to individual. Additionally, some of these results will be underpinned by methods that are not related to making inferences about populations like machine learning. So the question of whether this ""crisis"" is a genuine problem relates to how the information is likely to be used (i.e. EDP, EBM, policy development, etc.) or whether the fact that things don't replicate is to be expected.

Relative to lab based research it is less likely that field based research will be reproducible or replicable.  With field based research there are a multitude of variables that can effect or confound relationships or outcomes in experimental studies.  Consequently, it is likely that applied research in sport will be worse than other fields.  In conjunction, the field will likely have less resourcing therefore it is less likely that well controlled experimental studies can be undertaken relative to areas such as health.  However, if a researcher is working in the field alongside practitioners, they can I believe form an effective relationship using translational research that considers not just the variables measured but a  dashboard of metrics such as well being and information from relationships with athletes to enhance performance and well being for athletes and a team.

First, I think the last decades rise of the meta-analysis actually has created problems of what is a similar study or what is an identical study or what is a replication study - leading to issue of what aspects of a study  need/must be identical to be considered for reproducibility. Decades ago we only thought about this through providing an adequate description of method so that someone could replicate the study if need be. But now, I think that is entirely insufficient to allow for reproducibility. ",Very familiar,"Haha I like this. as I previously answered that the lines between replicability and reproducibility are now blurred. Actual replication of studies should be a requirement for certain findings, especially due to multiple forms of biases including misrepresentation within specific lab that are hard to escape from.  Without adequate requirements for publications on reproducibility then replication becomes very difficult.

If the approximation is inadequate then the study is not a replication. Now, if one is considering the robustness of a finding and it's extension to other populations or paradigms, then that is a slightly different than ""simple replication"". I find that the diversity in findings in our field is often related to the method used such as the selection of different but related outcome measures. In ACL research this is definitely the case, you can have diametrically opposed findings based upon the tools selected even given the same surgery. And finally, often things like coaching or PE pedagogy or rehabilitation practices (credentials do not equal competency) that are used in interventional studies are so poorly described and controlled that replication would be nearly impossible - sadly. ",Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,"I think that the answer is to help scientists wade through results of various related studies using approaches that are more intelligent and thorough than systematic reviews (especially ""paint by numbers"" meta-analyses). These approaches tend to coalesce findings forcibly. Also, many replication studies are not even formulated as they have lower chance of publication.

And I do think approach matters (see below). 

Anyways... exercise science is an applied field. Many of us work with and for athletes or patients. In these cases ""breakthrough"" discovery-type hype experiments are moot if they aren't generalizable. If what worked for these patients this one time over there in that lab doesn't work for the same type of patients at the hospital I'm at... then... 

Maybe because of this, there's less incentive for exercise scientists to chase the discovery dragon and instead take more of an engineering approach. It seems, to me, like the rep-crisis is most pronounced in fields that are furthest from performing experimentation directly on individual humans: the very small (cell/animal) and very big (sociology). 

But of course... I'm a human subject researcher! So my bias is that we're the best. ",Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,"Like I said before, it seems like the rep-crisis is less pronounced in applied fields (such as exercise science) where generalizability is the goal.

But if solving the rep-crisis involves increased labor/logistical load on researchers, then that load should be met with a commensurate increase in resource allocation. 

In the United States: doctoral researchers get paid <50%AMI for half a decade. Postdocs get paid ~80%AMI at best (in big cities... ya know... where the big unis are). We're creating market pressures for science to select for the bankrolled (rich parents) or the debt-friendly (those okay with debt). To me it seems like the former reduces diversity and the latter is bad for the future of our civilization.
